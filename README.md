# PaperEngine Project

PaperEngine is a game engine that my friend and I developed in C++ for a school project where we had to make a historical game. We decided to build our own engine from scratch using OpenGL as the RenderAPI because we wanted learn interesting stuff about rendering and writing an engine in general.

The engine is designed to be easy to use, flexible, and powerful. It works on Windows only for now, but we're thinking about adding support for other platforms like macOS and Linux. We didn't bother adding a physics renderer yet, but it's on our to-do list.

The Engine is inspired from TheCherno's [Hazel Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel "TheCherno - Hazel").

## How to install?

First to say, you don't need to install any dependencies because the necessary one are all statically linked.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/pascalgutsche/PaperEngine.git`

2. Go into the setup folder and execute the `setup.bat`.

3. In the setup script you will be asked for a project name. Enter it, but in `lower case`.

4. Last but not least, you have to execute the `build.bat` in the root directory. This is generating your .sln file for you so you can open the project in Visual Studio or whatever other program supports .sln files.

Now that you've successfully set up your project, take a look at the [Repository-Wiki](https://github.com/pascalgutsche/PaperEngine/wiki "PaperEngine") (WIP as of 04.05.2023) which explains how to end up using the engine.

## End things up
